# CLI Integration Testing - Quick Start Guide

## What We Built

A comprehensive, automated testing infrastructure that validates all CLI commands in real-world scenarios.

## Why This Matters

You identified a critical gap:
> "I have only utilized `clodo-service deploy` as a downstream developer. I haven't really gone full throttle to test the real environment effectiveness of the other options for developers."

This testing suite **solves that problem** by automatically, repeatedly, and progressively testing:
- ‚úÖ `clodo-create-service` (all 5 service types)
- ‚úÖ `clodo-init-service` (domain configuration)
- ‚úÖ `clodo-security` (validation & auditing)
- ‚úÖ End-to-end workflows

## Running Tests

### Test All CLIs
```powershell
npm run test:cli-integration
```

### Test Individual CLIs
```powershell
# Test service creation
npm run test:cli-create

# Test service initialization
npm run test:cli-init

# Test security validation
npm run test:cli-security

# Test complete workflows
npm run test:cli-e2e
```

## What Gets Tested

### clodo-create-service (22 Tests)
1. **All 5 service types**: generic, data-service, auth-service, content-service, api-gateway
2. **File generation**: Validates 67+ files are created
3. **Template replacement**: Ensures no {{VARIABLE}} placeholders remain
4. **Syntax validation**: JavaScript and JSON files are valid
5. **Error handling**: Empty names, invalid types, directory conflicts

### clodo-init-service (15 Tests)
1. **Domain configuration**: Manual and API-based
2. **Multi-domain support**: Multiple domains per service
3. **Environment configs**: development, staging, production
4. **Existing service handling**: Backup and overwrite
5. **Error handling**: Invalid domains, network failures, auth errors

### clodo-security (18 Tests)
1. **Security audits**: Configuration scanning
2. **Insecure detection**: Hardcoded secrets, weak patterns
3. **Pre-deployment validation**: Blocking on critical issues
4. **Secret generation**: Secure random generation
5. **Exit codes**: 0 on success, non-zero on failure

### End-to-End Workflows (6 Tests)
1. **Complete workflow**: Create ‚Üí Initialize ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Deploy
2. **Data service**: With database configuration
3. **Multi-service portfolio**: Multiple services in one workspace
4. **Service updates**: Reconfiguration support
5. **Error recovery**: Graceful handling and retry
6. **Validation chain**: Security validation at each step

## How It Works

### Test Isolation
Each test runs in a **fresh, isolated directory**:
```
C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp\clodo-cli-tests\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cli-test-create-service-generic-<timestamp>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cli-test-init-service-fresh-<timestamp>/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cli-test-security-audit-<timestamp>/
```

### Local Package Testing
Tests install **your local code**, not npm:
```javascript
// Installs from your workspace
npm install "C:\Users\Admin\Documents\...\clodo-framework"
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ Tests validate your **current changes**
- ‚úÖ No need to publish to test
- ‚úÖ Instant feedback on fixes

### Real CLI Execution
Tests run **actual CLI commands** with simulated input:
```javascript
await env.runCLI('clodo-create-service', {
  input: 'my-service\n1\ny\n'  // Service name, type, confirm
});
```

### Automatic Cleanup
- ‚úÖ **Success**: Environment deleted
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Failure**: Environment kept for inspection
- üßπ **Final**: All environments cleaned up

## Progressive Testing Workflow

### 1. After Code Changes
```powershell
npm run test:cli-integration
```
See if your changes broke anything.

### 2. Fix Issues Found
```powershell
# Tests failed? Inspect the preserved environment
cd $env:TEMP\clodo-cli-tests\<test-name>\
ls
```

### 3. Re-test
```powershell
npm run test:cli-integration
```
Validate your fixes worked.

### 4. Test Specific CLI
```powershell
# Only test the CLI you changed
npm run test:cli-create
```

### 5. Test Complete Workflows
```powershell
# Test everything works together
npm run test:cli-e2e
```

## Understanding Results

### ‚úÖ Success
```
‚úÖ Generic service created successfully
‚úÖ Generated 67 files
‚úÖ All JavaScript files are syntactically valid
```
Everything works as expected.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CLI requires API token (expected behavior)
‚ö†Ô∏è Report file not found (may use different naming)
```
Test skipped or expected behavior detected.

### ‚ùå Failures
```
‚ùå Test failed: Command failed: npx clodo-create-service
‚ùå Expected file not found: package.json
```
Something broke - needs fixing.

## What You'll Discover

Running these tests will reveal:

### üéØ What Works
- Which CLIs function correctly
- What file generation is complete
- Where error handling is good

### üîç What Needs Work
- Missing interactive prompts
- Unclear error messages
- Missing file validations
- Documentation gaps

### üí° What to Improve
- User experience friction points
- Edge cases not handled
- Performance bottlenecks
- Missing features

## Example: Testing Service Creation

```powershell
# Run service creation tests
npm run test:cli-create
```

**What happens:**
1. Creates fresh test directory
2. Installs your local framework
3. Runs `npx clodo-create-service` with input
4. Validates:
   - Service directory created
   - 67+ files generated
   - No {{VARIABLE}} placeholders
   - Valid JavaScript/JSON syntax
   - Correct package.json structure
5. Tests all 5 service types
6. Tests error scenarios
7. Cleans up test environments

**Output shows:**
```
üì¶ Step 1: Create service
‚úÖ Service created
üìä Generated 72 files
‚úÖ All 15 JavaScript files are syntactically valid
‚úÖ All 8 JSON files are valid
