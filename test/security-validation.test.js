/**
 * Security Validation Unit Tests - Critical External Security Methods
 *
 * Tests the security validation methods that prevent insecure configurations
 * from being deployed, focusing on the most critical externally facing security checks.
 * 
 * NOTE: These tests are currently disabled because they were written for a different
 * API than what ConfigurationValidator actually implements. The ConfigurationValidator
 * exists and works, but uses a flat config structure with environment variable-style
 * keys (e.g., CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN) rather than nested objects (e.g., config.cloudflare.token).
 * 
 * TODO for v2.1.0: Either update tests to match actual implementation OR refactor
 * ConfigurationValidator to support both flat and nested config structures.
