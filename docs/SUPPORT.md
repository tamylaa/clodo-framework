# Support & SLA — Clodo Framework

Thank you for using Clodo Framework! This document explains how to get help, what to expect in terms of response time, and how to escalate urgent issues.

Support channels
- Issues: https://github.com/tamyla/clodo-framework/issues — Use this for bugs, feature requests, and general questions. Please choose an appropriate issue template and include steps to reproduce and logs when possible.
- Email: product@clodo.dev — Use this for product questions, feedback, or security reports. We aim to acknowledge receipt within 2 business days.
- Discussions: https://github.com/tamyla/clodo-framework/discussions — Community Q&A, design discussion, and informal help.
- Twitter: https://twitter.com/clodoframework — Announcements and short updates.

Expected response times (SLA guidance)
- Security reports (email): Acknowledge within 1 business day; follow-up with a resolution plan within 3 business days.
- Critical bug (production affecting): Acknowledge within 1 business day; we will prioritize and provide status updates.
- Non-critical bug / feature request: We typically triage within 2 business days and may provide an ETA depending on priority.
- Community questions (Discussions / Issues): We aim to respond within 3 business days, subject to volunteer availability.

How to get our attention
- Star the repository and leave a short note/issue describing how you used the project — this helps attract contributors.
- Tweet about your use case and tag **@clodoframework** — we see and amplify community posts.
- Submit a small documentation or example PR — quick wins help others adopt the framework faster.

Reporting a security issue
- Please email product@clodo.dev with the subject `SECURITY REPORT: <short description>` and include reproduction steps and impact.

Escalation
- If you do not receive an acknowledgement for a security or critical production bug within the SLA windows above, reply to the original email and mark the message `URGENT`. We will escalate internally.

Support expectations
- This is an open-source project maintained by a small team and contributors. We prioritize issues by severity and community impact. Paid support or SLAs can be discussed for enterprise needs — contact product@clodo.dev to start the conversation.
