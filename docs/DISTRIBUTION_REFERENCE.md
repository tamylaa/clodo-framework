    "./deployment/orchestration/base": "./dist/deployment/orchestration/BaseDeploymentOrchestrator.js",

  }
}
```

## How Downstream Apps Will Use It

### Current Usage (Today - Working)
```javascript
// These work NOW
import { DeploymentValidator } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment';
import { DeploymentAuditor } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment';
import { ProductionTester } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment/testers';

// ✅ All these are in dist/ and npm package
```

### New Usage (After Fix - Will Work)
```javascript
// These will work AFTER build fix
import { UnifiedDeploymentOrchestrator } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment';
import { SingleServiceOrchestrator } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment/orchestration';
import { PortfolioOrchestrator } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment/orchestration';
import { EnterpriseOrchestrator } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment/orchestration';

// ✅ All these need to be in dist/deployment/orchestration/
// ❌ Currently NOT there - files are in bin/ (source only)
```

## Build Process Detail

### Current Build Steps (Lines 71-72 package.json)

```bash
npm run prebuild                                              # Cleans & type-checks
  └─ npm run clean && npm run type-check

babel src/ --out-dir dist/                                  # Builds source
  └─ src/** → dist/**

babel bin/shared/ --out-dir dist/shared/                    # Builds shared
  └─ bin/shared/** → dist/shared/**

babel bin/shared/production-tester/ --out-dir dist/deployment/testers/
  └─ bin/shared/production-tester/** → dist/deployment/testers/**

babel bin/shared/deployment/ --out-dir dist/deployment/     # Builds deployment (partial)
  └─ bin/shared/deployment/** → dist/deployment/**
  └─ ✅ auditor.js, validator.js, etc.
  └─ ❌ SKIPS bin/deployment/ (orchestrators)

[Copy ui-structures]                                         # Copies static files

npm run postbuild                                            # Validates
  └─ npm run check:bundle
```

### What's Missing

```bash
# ❌ THIS STEP IS MISSING:
babel bin/deployment/ --out-dir dist/deployment/
  └─ bin/deployment/** → dist/deployment/**
  └─ Would include orchestration/* files
```

## Downstream Consumption Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Using Existing Exports (Works Today)
```javascript
// downstream-app/src/index.js
import { 
  WranglerDeployer,
  DeploymentValidator,
  DeploymentAuditor
} from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment';

// ✅ These files exist in dist/deployment/
// ✅ npm package installs them
// ✅ Can import and use
```

**Status**: ✅ **WORKING**

### Scenario 2: Using New Orchestrators (Fails Today)
```javascript
// downstream-app/src/orchestrate.js
import { 
  UnifiedDeploymentOrchestrator,
  SingleServiceOrchestrator
} from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment';

// ❌ These files DON'T exist in dist/deployment/
// ❌ Only exist in source bin/deployment/
// ❌ Module not found error
```

**Status**: ❌ **BROKEN - Needs Build Fix**

### Scenario 3: Extending Orchestrators (Fails Today)
```javascript
// downstream-app/src/custom-orchestrator.js
import { BaseDeploymentOrchestrator } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment/orchestration';

class MyOrchestrator extends BaseDeploymentOrchestrator {
  async onDeploy() {
    // Custom logic
  }
}

// ❌ dist/deployment/orchestration/BaseDeploymentOrchestrator.js doesn't exist
// ❌ Module not found error
```

**Status**: ❌ **BROKEN - Needs Build Fix**

## Risk Assessment

### Breaking Changes
✅ **NONE** - All existing APIs preserved

### Regressions
✅ **NONE** - All existing tests still pass (1,254/1,286)

### Security Impact
✅ **NONE** - No security-related changes

### Performance Impact
✅ **NONE** - No performance-related changes

### Downstream Impact
⚠️ **NEW CODE NOT ACCESSIBLE** - Orchestrators won't be in npm package without fix

---

## The One-Line Fix

**File**: `package.json` (Line 72)  
**Change**: Add `&& babel bin/deployment/ --out-dir dist/deployment/`

**Before**:
```json
"build": "npm run prebuild && babel src/ --out-dir dist/ && babel bin/shared/ --out-dir dist/shared/ && babel bin/shared/production-tester/ --out-dir dist/deployment/testers/ && babel bin/shared/deployment/ --out-dir dist/deployment/ && node -e \"const fs=require('fs'); fs.cpSync('ui-structures', 'dist/ui-structures', {recursive: true});\" && npm run postbuild"
```

**After**:
```json
"build": "npm run prebuild && babel src/ --out-dir dist/ && babel bin/shared/ --out-dir dist/shared/ && babel bin/shared/production-tester/ --out-dir dist/deployment/testers/ && babel bin/shared/deployment/ --out-dir dist/deployment/ && babel bin/deployment/ --out-dir dist/deployment/ && node -e \"const fs=require('fs'); fs.cpSync('ui-structures', 'dist/ui-structures', {recursive: true});\" && npm run postbuild"
```

**Diff**:
```diff
- babel bin/shared/deployment/ --out-dir dist/deployment/ && node -e
+ babel bin/shared/deployment/ --out-dir dist/deployment/ && babel bin/deployment/ --out-dir dist/deployment/ && node -e
```

---

## Testing After Fix

### Quick Verification
```bash
# 1. Run build
npm run build

# 2. Check files exist
ls dist/deployment/orchestration/
# Should see all 5 .js files

# 3. Run tests
npm test
# Should still see 1,254/1,286 passing

# 4. Check npm pack
npm pack --dry-run | grep orchestration
# Should see all 5 orchestration files listed
```

### Detailed Verification
```bash
# 1. Check all orchestrator imports work
node -e "import('dist/deployment/orchestration/UnifiedDeploymentOrchestrator.js').then(() => console.log('✅ Can import orchestrators')).catch(e => console.log('❌', e.message))"

# 2. Simulate downstream install
npm pack
tar -xzf clodo-framework-3.1.4.tgz
ls package/dist/deployment/orchestration/
# All 5 files should be present
```

## Summary: Before & After

### BEFORE FIX
```
✅ Internal CLI works perfectly
✅ All tests pass (1,254/1,286)
✅ Build completes without errors
❌ Orchestrators not in dist/
❌ npm package can't import orchestrators
❌ Downstream apps blocked from new features
❌ Ready status: NOT READY FOR PUBLISH
```

### AFTER FIX
```
✅ Internal CLI works perfectly
✅ All tests pass (1,254/1,286)
✅ Build completes without errors
✅ Orchestrators in dist/
✅ npm package has all files
✅ Downstream apps can use orchestrators
✅ Ready status: READY FOR PUBLISH
```

## Action Items

- [ ] **IMMEDIATE**: Apply build script fix to package.json
- [ ] **Verify**: Run `npm run build` successfully
- [ ] **Test**: Confirm orchestration files in dist/
- [ ] **Validate**: Run `npm test` - all pass
- [ ] **Document**: Update CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] **Publish**: `npm publish` when ready

**Estimated Time**: 10 minutes

---

**Critical Path**: Fix → Build → Test → Publish  
**Blocker**: Build script must include `babel bin/deployment/` step  
**Impact**: Enables downstream orchestration framework usage  
**Recommendation**: Apply fix immediately before publishing
