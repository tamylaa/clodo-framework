# Founder & Admin License System

This document explains how to grant unlimited free access to the framework builder and selected team members.

## Overview

The Clodo Framework includes a special license system for:
- **Founder License**: Unlimited access for the framework builder (never expires)
- **Admin License**: Unlimited access for selected team members/contributors (never expires)

These licenses bypass all usage limits and provide full access to all features.

## Generating Founder License

As the framework builder, generate your founder license:

```bash
# Generate founder license for yourself
clodo-service generate-founder-license --email "your-email@example.com" --name "Your Name"

# Example:
clodo-service generate-founder-license --email "builder@clodo-framework.com" --name "Framework Builder"
```

## Generating Admin Licenses

Grant unlimited access to selected team members:

```bash
# Generate admin license for team member
clodo-service generate-founder-license --admin --email "team-member@example.com" --name "Team Member Name"

# Examples:
clodo-service generate-founder-license --admin --email "contributor@company.com" --name "Core Contributor"
clodo-service generate-founder-license --admin --email "beta-tester@example.com" --name "Beta Tester"
```

## Checking License Status

## Security Notes

- Licenses are stored locally in `~/.clodo-framework/license.json`
- Founder licenses can only be generated by running the CLI command
- Each license has a unique ID for tracking
- License files are user-specific and not transferable

## Distribution

Share the license generation command with trusted team members:

```bash
# Send this command to team members
clodo-service generate-founder-license --admin --email "their-email@example.com" --name "Their Name"
```

They can then run this command on their system to activate unlimited access.

## Troubleshooting

If you need to reset or change a license:

1. Delete the license file: `rm ~/.clodo-framework/license.json`
2. Re-run the license generation command
3. Check status with: `clodo-service usage`

- Cloud-based license validation
