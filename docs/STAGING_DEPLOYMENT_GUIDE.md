## 🔐 Staging Credentials Setup

### Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)

```bash
# Set staging credentials
export CF_TOKEN="your-staging-cloudflare-token"
export CF_ACCOUNT_ID="your-staging-account-id"

# Verify credentials are set (don't echo actual values!)
echo "✅ Credentials configured"
```

### Option 2: CLI Flags

```bash
# Deploy with CLI flags
npx clodo-service deploy \
  --token "your-staging-token" \
  --account-id "your-staging-account-id" \
  --environment staging \
  --config config/examples/environment-mapped.json
```

### Option 3: Interactive Prompt

```bash
# Deploy with interactive credential entry
npx clodo-service deploy --environment staging
# System will prompt for credentials if not in environment
```

---

## 📝 Staging Configuration

### Using Environment-Mapped Example

```bash
# Create staging deployment configuration
cp config/examples/environment-mapped.json config/staging-deployment.json

# Edit to use staging-specific values
# - Update domain names if different
# - Update zone IDs for staging zones
# - Update database connection for staging DB
# - Update secrets references
nano config/staging-deployment.json
```

### Staging Configuration Features

```json
{
  "domains": [
    {
      "name": "api-staging.example.com",
      "environment": "staging",
      "settings": {
        "rateLimit": { "requests": 5000 },  // Staging limits
        "caching": { "enabled": true, "ttl": 1800 }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Execution

### Step 1: Dry-Run Verification

```bash
# Preview deployment without making changes
npx clodo-service deploy \
  --config config/staging-deployment.json \
  --environment staging \
  --dry-run

# Expected output shows:
# ✅ Domain detection
# ✅ Configuration validation
# ✅ Deployment plan
# ✅ No actual changes made
```

### Step 2: Actual Deployment

```bash
# Execute actual deployment
npx clodo-service deploy \
  --config config/staging-deployment.json \
  --environment staging \
  --all-domains

# Expected output shows:
# ✅ Deploying to staging domains
# ✅ Orchestrator execution
# ✅ Results and audit logs
# ✅ SUCCESS status
```

### Step 3: Deployment Verification

```bash
# Check deployment status
npx clodo-service status \
  --environment staging \
  --all-domains

# Expected: All domains DEPLOYED and ACTIVE
```

---

## ✅ Validation Tests

### Health Checks

```bash
# Test API domain
curl https://api-staging.example.com/health

# Expected response:
# { "status": "ok", "timestamp": "2025-10-28T..." }

# Test CDN domain (if multi-domain)
curl https://cdn-staging.example.com/health

# Test Admin domain (if configured)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://admin-staging.example.com/admin/health
```

### Authentication Tests

```bash
# Test with valid credentials
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $STAGING_TOKEN" \
  https://api-staging.example.com/api/v1/protected

# Expected: 200 OK

# Test without credentials
curl https://api-staging.example.com/api/v1/protected

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized or similar
```

### Rate Limiting Tests

```bash
# Send multiple requests rapidly
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl https://api-staging.example.com/health
done

# Expected behavior:
# First N requests succeed
# Subsequent requests may get rate limit response
# Rate limit should be based on staging config (5000 req/min)
```

### Database Connectivity

```bash
# Test database-dependent endpoint
curl https://api-staging.example.com/api/v1/data

# Expected: 200 OK with data
# Indicates database connection working
```

Cache Hit Rate: 80%+ (for cached endpoints)
Database Query Time: < 100ms
Timeout Rate: < 0.1%
Error Rate: < 0.1%

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Domain not resolving
```
Solution: Check DNS records are updated in staging zone
Command: dig api-staging.example.com
```

**Issue**: Authentication failing
```
Solution: Verify staging credentials in environment
Command: echo $CF_TOKEN (should not be empty)
```

**Issue**: Slow response times
```
Solution: Check database connection and cache status
Command: npx clodo-service metrics --environment staging
```

**Issue**: Rate limiting too aggressive
```
Solution: Adjust rate limit settings in config
File: config/staging-deployment.json
Key: rateLimit.requests
```
