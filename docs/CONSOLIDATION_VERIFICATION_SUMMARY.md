- `validateDomain()` - Lines ~785
- `testDomain()` - Lines ~817
- ... and 15+ more methods

- Different module-based approach but same functionality

### Result of Consolidation
All **27+ duplicate methods** across 3 systems → **Consolidated into unified framework**:
- ✅ 6 phase methods in `BaseDeploymentOrchestrator`

import EnterpriseDeploymentCLI from './bin/deployment/enterprise-deploy.js';
const cli = new EnterpriseDeploymentCLI();
await cli.initialize();
await cli.deploy('example.com');

// Result: ✅ Works perfectly
```

**New code available**:
```javascript
// NEW CODE (recommended)
import { UnifiedDeploymentOrchestrator } from './bin/deployment/orchestration/UnifiedDeploymentOrchestrator.js';
const orchestrator = new UnifiedDeploymentOrchestrator();
orchestrator.setDeploymentMode('single');
const result = await orchestrator.execute();

// Result: ✅ All features available
```
