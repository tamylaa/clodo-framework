# Security Policy

We take security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Email:** product@clodo.dev with subject `SECURITY REPORT: <short description>` including steps to reproduce and impact.
2. **Acknowledge:** We aim to acknowledge all security reports within 1 business day.
3. **Follow-up:** We will provide a remediation plan within 3 business days and keep you updated until a fix is released.

If you prefer, you may also open an issue and mark it private/secure (or include `SECURITY:` in the title) — but email is preferred for confidential reports.

We do not accept unsolicited code changes submitted in pull requests for reported vulnerabilities; we will coordinate remediation privately as needed.
