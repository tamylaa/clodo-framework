## 🎯 The Complete Todo System

### 15 Actionable Tasks (All Mapped & Connected)

**Phase 1: Standardization** (12-16 hours)
- ✏️ Task 1.1: StandardOptions class → All commands use same global options
- ✏️ Task 1.2: OutputFormatter class → Unified output handling
- ✏️ Task 1.3: ProgressManager class → Consistent spinners/progress
- ✏️ Task 1.4: ConfigLoader class → JSON configuration support

**Phase 2: Feature Parity** (8-12 hours)
- ✏️ Task 2.1: Shared utility functions → Eliminate code duplication
- ✏️ Task 2.2: Error handling & exit codes → Consistency
- ✏️ Task 2.3: Feature parity → All commands equivalent

**Phase 3: Quality Assurance** (6-10 hours)
- ✏️ Task 3.1: Integration tests → Test each command
- ✏️ Task 3.2: Utilities tests → Test shared code
- ✏️ Task 3.3: E2E scenario tests → Test workflows

**Phase 4: Professional Edition** (4-8 hours)
- ✏️ Task 4.1: New commands (help, version, login)
- ✏️ Task 4.2: Advanced logging (file output, log levels)
- ✏️ Task 4.3: Legacy aliases (backward compatibility)
