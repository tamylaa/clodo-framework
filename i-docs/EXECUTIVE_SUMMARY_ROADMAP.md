## Resource Requirements

### For Complete 4-Week Build

**Single Developer**
- 160 hours (4 weeks full-time)
- Recommended

**Two Developers**
- 80 hours each (2.5 weeks)
- Better for parallel testing

**Three Developers**
- 50-60 hours each (2 weeks)
- Tasks can be parallelized

**QA/Testing**
- 40 hours (1 week dedicated)
- Or integrated with development

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| State Corruption | 🔴 High | 🟢 Low | Checksums + recovery |
| Discovery Accuracy | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium | Real-world testing |
| Config Edge Cases | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium | Template coverage |
| Breaking Changes | 🔴 High | 🟡 Medium | Beta releases + migration guide |
| Performance Regression | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low | Benchmarking + CI/CD |

---

## Decision Points

### ✅ Approved
1. **Pursue Data Bridge First** - Foundation for everything else
2. **Parallel Development** - IDENTIFY and CONSTRUCT can be worked on together
3. **Beta Releases** - v3.1-beta, v3.2-beta, v3.3-beta for early feedback
4. **Maintain Backward Compatibility** - Careful deprecation warnings

### 🤔 To Decide
1. **Release Strategy**: 
   - Option A: Release v3.1, v3.2, v3.3 separately (incremental)
   - Option B: Bundle as v4.0.0 (major update)
   - **Recommendation**: Option A (incremental + faster delivery)

2. **Testing Priority**:
   - Option A: Comprehensive coverage first (slower delivery)
   - Option B: Good coverage now, improve over time (faster delivery)
   - **Recommendation**: Option A (enterprise requires high confidence)

3. **Documentation**:
   - Option A: Complete docs before release (slower)
   - Option B: Release with beta docs (faster iteration)
   - **Recommendation**: Option B (community can help refine)

## Budget & Resources

### Development Cost (4 weeks, 1 developer)
```
160 hours × $75/hour = $12,000
Or: 1 FTE for 4 weeks

With 2 developers:
80 hours each × $75/hour × 2 = $12,000 (2.5 weeks)

With 3 developers:
50-60 hours each × $75/hour × 3 = $11,250 (2 weeks)
```

### Infrastructure Cost
```
npm Registry: FREE (public package)
GitHub: FREE (open source)
Storage: Minimal (< 100MB)
Total: ~$0
```

### Opportunity Cost
```
4 weeks of development capacity
2 weeks if parallelized
Worth it: Reaches enterprise readiness and revenue potential
```
