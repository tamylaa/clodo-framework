## 🎯 NEXT WEEK (Oct 21-25) - Phase 1.5 Completion Planning

### Investigate Data-Bridge Failures (1-2 hours)
**Goal**: Understand root cause of 45 failing tests

**Steps:**

2. [ ] Identify pattern in failures (all validation? specific phases?)
3. [ ] Check if issue is in:
   - [ ] Schemas (phaseId, metadata fields)
   - [ ] Validation logic
   - [ ] Test data
   - [ ] State persistence logic
4. [ ] Document findings in `DEBUG_DATA_BRIDGE_ISSUES.md`
5. [ ] Estimate effort to fix

**If Simple Fix (<30 min)**:
- [ ] Implement fix
- [ ] Run tests to verify
- [ ] Release v3.0.13 hotfix

**If Complex (1+ hour)**:
- [ ] Schedule for v3.1.0 sprint
- [ ] Document for next developer
- [ ] Move to PHASE 1.5 tasks below

### Begin v3.1.0 Planning (1-2 hours)

## 🔄 DECISION WORKFLOWS

### If Data-Bridge Fix is Simple
```
1. Fix now (v3.0.12.1 or v3.0.13)
2. Re-run tests
3. Re-release
4. Update release notes
```

### If Data-Bridge Fix is Complex
```
1. Document issue
2. Schedule for v3.1.0
3. Release v3.0.12 as-is (with known issue noted)
4. Create task for next sprint
```

### If Strategic Approval Not Received
```
1. Hold v3.0.12 release pending approval
2. Continue Phase 1.5 work in parallel
3. Prepare for AICOEVV separation regardless
```

## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATIONS

### Risk: Release with Known Issues
**Mitigation**: Clearly document in release notes, note as v3.0.12 with caveat

### Risk: Data-Bridge Fix Takes Longer Than Expected
**Mitigation**: Have v3.1.0 as backup timeline, don't block release

### Risk: Team Capacity Issues
**Mitigation**: Prioritize (Release > Fix > Features), defer if needed

### Risk: Stakeholder Doesn't Approve Separation
**Mitigation**: Continue with Phase 1.5 regardless, separation is post-1.5
