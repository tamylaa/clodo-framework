## 🎯 The 15 Tasks (All Documented & Connected)

### Phase 1: Standardization (12-16 hours)
- [ ] **1.1**: StandardOptions class → Make all 6 commands consistent
- [ ] **1.2**: OutputFormatter class → Unified output handling
- [ ] **1.3**: ProgressManager class → Consistent progress indicators
- [ ] **1.4**: ConfigLoader class → JSON configuration support
- **Outcome**: v3.2.0 - Standardized CLI

### Phase 2: Feature Parity (8-12 hours)
- [ ] **2.1**: Shared utility functions → Eliminate duplication
- [ ] **2.2**: Error handling & exit codes → Consistency
- [ ] **2.3**: Feature parity → All commands equivalent
- **Outcome**: v3.3.0 - Zero tech debt

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (6-10 hours)
- [ ] **3.1**: Integration tests → Command verification
- [ ] **3.2**: Utilities tests → Code verification
- [ ] **3.3**: E2E scenario tests → Workflow verification
- **Outcome**: v3.4.0 - >90% test coverage

### Phase 4: Professional Edition (4-8 hours)
- [ ] **4.1**: New commands (help, version, login)
