## 📦 Package Distribution Policy

**CRITICAL**: Files in this `i-docs/` folder are **NEVER** included in npm package distribution. Only essential, public-facing documentation from `../docs/` is bundled with the package.

The following docs are distributed with the npm package:
- `docs/README.md` - Main documentation index
- `docs/overview.md` - Framework overview
- `docs/SECURITY.md` - Security documentation
- `docs/api-reference.md` - API reference

All other documentation (including this i-docs folder) remains repository-only.

## 📝 Contributing

When adding new internal documentation:
1. Place it in the appropriate subdirectory (`architecture/`, `analysis/`, `deployment/`, `guides/`, etc.)
2. Add a brief description to this README under the relevant section
3. Ensure no sensitive information is included
4. Consider if the document should eventually be moved to public docs when appropriate

## 🔄 Lifecycle

Internal documents may be moved to the public `docs/` folder when:
- Information becomes stable and developer-relevant
- Security reviews are completed
- Business approval is granted
- Content is sanitized for public consumption

## 📊 Recent Changes

**Phase 2 Content Consolidation (October 2025)**:
- Consolidated 40+ scattered documents into 8 comprehensive guides
- Organized content into logical subdirectories (architecture/, analysis/, deployment/, guides/)
- Eliminated redundancy while preserving all valuable technical content
- Improved discoverability and maintenance efficiency
