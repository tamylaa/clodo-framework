## üì¶ Package Distribution Policy

**CRITICAL**: Files in this `i-docs/` folder are **NEVER** included in npm package distribution. Only essential, public-facing documentation from `../docs/` is bundled with the package.

The following docs are distributed with the npm package:
- `docs/README.md` - Main documentation index
- `docs/overview.md` - Framework overview
- `docs/SECURITY.md` - Security documentation
- `docs/api-reference.md` - API reference

All other documentation (including this i-docs folder) remains repository-only.

## üìù Contributing

When adding new internal documentation:
1. Place it in this `i-docs/` folder
2. Add a brief description to this README
3. Ensure no sensitive information is included
4. Consider if the document should eventually be moved to public docs when appropriate

## üîÑ Lifecycle

Internal documents may be moved to the public `docs/` folder when:
- Information becomes stable and developer-relevant
- Security reviews are completed
- Business approval is granted
- Content is sanitized for public consumption</content>
