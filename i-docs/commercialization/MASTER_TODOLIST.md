### Weekly Workflow

1. **Monday morning:** Review week's tasks
2. **Daily:** Check off completed tasks
3. **Friday evening:** Review week's progress
4. **Sunday evening:** Plan next week

### Task Workflow

1. **Before starting:** Read task description
2. **During work:** Use acceptance criteria to validate
3. **After completion:** Check off in todolist
4. **Test:** Ensure acceptance criteria met

### Progress Tracking

## 💡 Implementation Tips

### Batch Similar Tasks
- Group documentation tasks
- Group video creation (script once, record all)
- Group CI/CD templates (create systematically)

### Leverage Existing Code
- You already have all the features!
- Reuse existing examples
- Don't rebuild what exists

### Parallel Processing
- Weeks 1-2: Docs while planning weeks 3-4
- Weeks 5-6: CLI while preparing examples
- Weeks 9-11: Community while finishing features

### Testing Each Task
- Test documentation examples
- Test CLI commands locally
- Test CI/CD templates in real workflow
- Test video uploads and embedding
