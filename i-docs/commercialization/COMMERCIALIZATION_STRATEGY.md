# Clodo Commercialization Strategy

## Executive Summary

Clodo represents a paradigm shift in Cloudflare application development, moving from single-service thinking to distributed application construction. Our two-level architecture (clodo-framework + clodo-application) enables us to build a sustainable business with strong network effects and high switching costs.

**Mission:** Democratize distributed application development on Cloudflare by providing the LEGO bricks (services) and instructions (orchestration) for building globally scalable applications.

**Business Model:** Freemium SaaS with capability-based pricing tiers, creating sticky monetization through orchestration lock-in and network effects.
