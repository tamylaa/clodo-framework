## üé¨ POSITIONING

**NOT selling features. Selling licensing freedom.**

```
‚ùå "Buy Pro to get assessment"
‚úÖ "Assessment is free. Pay if you want proprietary."

‚ùå "Enterprise tier has more capabilities"
‚úÖ "Everything is available. Pay for license if using in SaaS."

‚ùå "Pro is better than Community"
‚úÖ "Community is fully featured. Pay to remove GPL requirements."
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Why GPL instead of MIT?**  
A: GPL generates revenue by preventing proprietary use without licensing. MIT would mean no licensing revenue.

**Q: Why not SaaS instead?**  
A: SaaS requires managing infrastructure, support, scalability. This is simpler: publish packages, let customers run.

**Q: Can users use Community forever free?**  
A: Yes. Community (MIT) is unrestricted. They can use commercially, modify, anything.

**Q: What if they want Professional but open-source?**  
A: Free! GPL only requires openness. If they comply, no cost.

**Q: What if they want Professional but proprietary?**  
A: License required. $100-300/month for seat licenses.

**Q: Aren't you splitting the codebase?**  
A: No. Orchestration is extracted as separate package, but same code. Updates go to both.

**Q: How do you handle GPL compliance?**  
A: That's their problem. You publish under GPL, they decide if they comply.

## üí° THE BEAUTIFUL PART

```
You build ONCE, monetize THREE ways:

1. Community adoption ‚Üí Network effects ‚Üí Market dominance
2. Professional licensing ‚Üí Recurring revenue from proprietary users
3. Services/consulting ‚Üí Immediate high-margin revenue

This is how Redis, Elastic, MongoDB, Terraform do it.

You're executing enterprise software strategy from day 1.
