## Identified Gaps & Blind Spots

### üö® CRITICAL GAP: CLI Developer Experience Testing

**Current State:**
- 4 CLI entry points implemented:
  1. ‚úÖ `clodo-service` - **TESTED** (deploy command validated downstream)
  2. ‚ö†Ô∏è `clodo-create-service` - **UNTESTED** in real developer environments
  3. ‚ö†Ô∏è `clodo-init-service` - **UNTESTED** in real developer environments
  4. ‚ö†Ô∏è `clodo-security` - **UNTESTED** in real developer environments

**Problem Statement:**
> "I have only utilized `clodo-service deploy` as a downstream developer. I haven't really gone full throttle to test the real environment effectiveness of the other options for developers... that is definitely a gap and blindspot... need to work on those."
>
> ‚Äî Framework Author, October 21, 2025

**Impact:**
- **CLI Developer UX** rating: ‚ö†Ô∏è **GAP** (vs competitors: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê or ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
- Untested CLIs may have:
  - Installation issues
  - Path resolution problems
  - Interactive prompt failures
  - Documentation gaps
  - Poor error messages
  - Missing edge case handling

**Remediation Required:**

#### Phase 1: Real Developer Environment Testing (URGENT)
```bash
# Test each CLI in fresh environment
1. Create test project in new directory
2. Install @tamyla/clodo-framework@3.0.14
3. Run each CLI command with various inputs:
   - clodo-create-service (all 5 service types)
   - clodo-init-service (domain configuration)
   - clodo-security (validation checks)
4. Document all friction points
5. Test error scenarios (invalid inputs, missing deps, etc.)
```

#### Phase 2: CLI Documentation Enhancement
- Add CLI-specific tutorials to i-docs/
- Create video walkthroughs
- Document common pitfalls
- Add troubleshooting guides

#### Phase 3: CLI Integration Testing
- Add automated CLI integration tests
- Test in CI/CD environment
- Validate cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Test with different Node.js versions

#### Phase 4: Developer Onboarding Flow
- Create "First 5 Minutes" guide for each CLI
- Add interactive examples
- Build CLI command cheat sheet
- Add success metrics tracking

**Target State:**
- All 4 CLIs tested in real developer environments
- Comprehensive CLI documentation (tutorials, examples, troubleshooting)
- Automated CLI integration tests in test suite
- Developer feedback incorporated
- CLI Developer UX rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

### Additional Minor Gaps

**Market Visibility** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Despite technical excellence, framework isn't widely known
- Need: Marketing strategy, conference talks, blog posts, case studies

**Cloudflare-Specific Coupling** ‚ÑπÔ∏è
- Tight coupling limits market (but validates niche dominance)
- Consider: Multi-cloud abstraction layer for broader appeal (or stay focused)

**Community Size** ‚ÑπÔ∏è
- Small user base vs established frameworks
- Need: Open source community building, Discord/Slack channels, contribution guides
