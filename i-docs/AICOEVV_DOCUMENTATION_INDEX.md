## üí° Key Insights

### What You Got Right
- Assessment engine is class-leading quality
- Orchestration is sophisticated and enterprise-grade
- Three-tier UX is excellent
- Modular architecture enables easy enhancement

### What You Need to Fix
- Formal data contracts between phases (DataBridge)
- Business requirements verification (BusinessValidator)
- Comprehensive functional testing integration

### Why It Matters
- Without DataBridge: Can't recover from failures, can't audit state
- Without BusinessValidator: Can't prove deployment succeeded
- Together: These enable true enterprise production deployments
