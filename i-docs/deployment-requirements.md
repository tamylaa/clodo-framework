# Bulletproof Deployment System Requirements

## Core Principles
1. **Zero Manual Intervention**: Once started, should complete without human input
2. **Fail Fast**: Validate everything upfront before starting any changes
3. **Rollback Capable**: Can undo changes if something fails
4. **Secret Distribution**: Automatically share secrets with upstream/downstream apps
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Validate deployment success end-to-end

## Current Issues Identified
1. **wrangler vs npx wrangler** - Not consistently handled
2. **Migration conflicts** - Existing tables cause failures
3. **Secret deployment failures** - No validation that secrets were actually set
4. **No rollback mechanism** - If deployment fails partway through
5. **No upstream/downstream secret sharing** - Critical for real applications
6. **No prerequisite validation** - Should check auth, network, dependencies first

## Required Components

### 1. Pre-deployment Validation
- [ ] Cloudflare authentication check
- [ ] Network connectivity validation
- [ ] NPM dependencies verification
- [ ] Existing deployment conflict detection
- [ ] Domain name availability check

### 2. Secret Management System
- [ ] Generate consistent secrets across all services
- [ ] Deploy secrets to Cloudflare Workers
- [ ] Export secrets for upstream applications (API format)
- [ ] Export secrets for downstream applications (ENV format)
- [ ] Validate secret deployment was successful
- [ ] Secret versioning and rotation support

### 3. Database Management
- [ ] Smart migration handling (detect existing schema)
- [ ] Migration rollback capability
- [ ] Data consistency validation
- [ ] Foreign key relationship verification

### 4. Deployment Pipeline
- [ ] Step-by-step progress tracking
- [ ] Automatic retry for transient failures
- [ ] Complete rollback on permanent failures
- [ ] Deployment success validation
- [ ] Performance baseline establishment

### 5. Integration Testing
- [ ] Authentication flow end-to-end test
- [ ] CRUD operations validation
- [ ] Business logic module testing
- [ ] Performance and load testing
- [ ] Security validation

### 6. Documentation and Monitoring
- [ ] Auto-generated deployment report
- [ ] Health monitoring setup
- [ ] Error logging and alerting
- [ ] Usage analytics baseline

## Success Criteria
- Single command deployment to any new domain
- Zero manual secret configuration required
- All upstream/downstream apps receive secrets automatically
- Complete validation that deployment is production-ready
- Clear rollback procedure if issues are discovered
