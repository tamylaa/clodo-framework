# Documentation Workflow Guidelines

## Executive Summary

**Framework for maintaining clean, organized documentation** to prevent accumulation while ensuring comprehensive coverage. Establishes clear processes for document lifecycle management, consolidation triggers, and quality standards.

### Key Principles
- **Consolidate Early**: Merge related documents within 2 weeks of creation
- **One Source of Truth**: Each topic has a single authoritative document
- **Regular Cleanup**: Monthly review and consolidation of temporary documents
- **Quality Gates**: All documents meet minimum standards before publication

### Impact Prevention
- **Document Accumulation**: Systematic consolidation prevents buildup
- **Maintenance Burden**: Clear ownership and update processes
- **Discoverability**: Organized structure with consistent naming
- **Developer Experience**: Easy to find and use documentation

## Document Categories & Lifecycle

### 1. **Temporary Documents** (Auto-Archive in 2 Weeks)
**Purpose**: Session tracking, immediate debugging, planning
**Examples**: Session reports, test outputs, planning docs
**Lifecycle**:
- Create with `TEMP_` prefix
- Auto-archive after 14 days
- Consolidate valuable content before archiving

### 2. **Working Documents** (Consolidate Within 1 Month)
**Purpose**: Analysis, design, implementation planning
**Examples**: Architecture analysis, feature design, optimization plans
**Lifecycle**:
- Create in appropriate category directory
- Consolidate related documents monthly
- Promote stable content to permanent docs

### 3. **Reference Documents** (Maintain Indefinitely)
**Purpose**: Authoritative guides, API docs, architecture decisions
**Examples**: User guides, API references, architectural decisions
**Lifecycle**:
- Create in consolidated format
- Regular review and updates
- Version control with change tracking

### 4. **Archive Documents** (Preserve for History)
**Purpose**: Historical record, audit trail, lessons learned
**Examples**: Phase completion reports, consolidation summaries
**Lifecycle**:
- Move to `backups/documentation/` after consolidation
- Keep for 1 year minimum
- Compress after 6 months

## Directory Structure Standards

### Primary Organization
```
i-docs/
├── architecture/     # Architectural decisions and design
├── analysis/         # Technical analysis and optimization
├── deployment/       # Deployment and configuration
├── guides/           # Developer and user guides
├── session-reports/  # Temporary session tracking
├── roadmap/          # Strategic planning
├── commercialization/ # Business strategy
├── examples/         # Code examples
├── quickstart-templates/ # Project templates
└── api/              # API documentation
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: `TOPIC_SUBJECT.md` (e.g., `DOMAIN_ROUTES_AUTOMATION.md`)
- **Directories**: Lowercase, hyphen-separated (e.g., `session-reports/`)
- **Temporary**: `TEMP_TOPIC_SUBJECT.md` (auto-archived)
- **Archives**: `backups/documentation/TOPIC_SUBJECT_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### File Organization Rules
1. **One Topic Per File**: Each file covers a single, coherent topic
2. **Logical Grouping**: Related files in same directory
3. **Clear Hierarchy**: Use subdirectories for complex topics
4. **Consistent Structure**: Standard sections across similar documents

## Document Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Document Need
**Before creating any document, ask:**
- Does this information already exist elsewhere?
- Can this be added to an existing document?
- Is this temporary (session/debugging) or permanent?

**Decision Tree**:
```
New information needed?
├── Yes → Is it temporary? (session/debugging/planning)
│   ├── Yes → Create with TEMP_ prefix, schedule for consolidation
│   └── No → Does it fit existing document?
│       ├── Yes → Add to existing document
│       └── No → Create new document in appropriate category
└── No → Update existing document or reference
```

### Step 2: Choose Location & Format
**Location Selection**:
- `architecture/` - Design decisions, architectural analysis
- `analysis/` - Technical analysis, optimization, validation
- `deployment/` - Configuration, deployment, operations
- `guides/` - Tutorials, how-tos, user guides
- `session-reports/` - Daily/weekly progress (temporary)

**Format Standards**:
- Markdown with consistent header hierarchy
- Executive summary first (3-5 bullet points)
- Clear section structure with descriptive headers
- Code examples in fenced blocks with language tags

### Step 3: Create with Standards
**Required Sections** (for permanent documents):
```markdown
# Document Title

## Executive Summary
Brief overview (3-5 bullets) of what's covered and key takeaways.

## [Main Section 1]
Detailed content...

## [Main Section 2]
Detailed content...

## [Appendices/References]
Additional resources, related documents, etc.
```

**Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] Clear, descriptive title
- [ ] Executive summary present
- [ ] Logical section organization
- [ ] No duplicate content with existing docs
- [ ] Proper grammar and formatting
- [ ] Links to related documents
- [ ] Added to i-docs/README.md

## Consolidation Process

### Trigger Conditions
**Consolidate when**:
- 3+ related documents exist on same topic
- Document exceeds 500 lines without clear sections
- Temporary documents reach 2-week age
- Monthly review identifies consolidation opportunities

### Consolidation Workflow
1. **Identify Related Documents**
   - Search for similar topics/names
   - Review document inventory
   - Check for overlapping content

2. **Plan Consolidation Structure**
   - Executive summary from all sources
   - Logical section organization
   - Preserve all valuable content
   - Eliminate redundancy

3. **Create Consolidated Document**
   - New comprehensive document
   - Cross-reference all sources
   - Update navigation/links
   - Test all referenced procedures

4. **Cleanup & Verification**
   - Remove original documents
   - Update all references
   - Verify no broken links
   - Update i-docs/README.md

### Consolidation Examples
**Before**: 4 separate domain routes docs
```
docs/ADR_DOMAIN_ROUTES_AUTOMATION.md
docs/DOMAIN_ROUTES_AUTOMATION_DESIGN.md
docs/DOMAIN_ROUTES_AUTOMATION_EXAMPLES.md
docs/DOMAIN_ROUTES_AUTOMATION_USER_GUIDE.md
```

**After**: 1 comprehensive guide
```
i-docs/architecture/DOMAIN_ROUTES_AUTOMATION.md

├── Architecture Decision Record
├── Technical Design
├── Implementation Examples
└── User Guide
