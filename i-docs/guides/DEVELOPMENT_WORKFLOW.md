# Development Workflow Guide

## Executive Summary

**Complete development workflow for clodo-framework** covering git operations, build processes, distribution, and downstream consumption patterns. Includes critical build fix for Phase 3.3.5 orchestrator distribution.

### Key Workflows
- **Git Workflow**: Simple sync-based workflow to avoid push rejections
- **Build Process**: Multi-step compilation with critical orchestrator fix
- **Distribution**: npm package creation with all Phase 3.3.5 features
- **Downstream Usage**: How external apps consume the framework

### Critical Issues Addressed
- **Build Gap**: Orchestrator files not compiled to dist/ (FIXED)
- **Distribution Block**: New features unavailable to npm consumers (RESOLVED)
- **Git Conflicts**: Push rejections from semantic-release (PREVENTED)

---

## Git Workflow

### The Problem: Push Rejections
Semantic-release automatically pushes version bumps to master. If you push without pulling first → rejected push error.

### Simple Solution: Always Sync

```bash
# Before starting work
npm run sync

# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: your changes"

# Before pushing
npm run sync

# Push
git push
```

### Even Simpler Alternative
```bash
# One command that does everything safely
npm run push:safe
```
*(Note: Currently has emoji encoding issues in PowerShell, use manual workflow above)*

### Why This Works
- `npm run sync` pulls latest changes and rebases your work on top
- Prevents conflicts with semantic-release automated pushes
- Keeps your branch up-to-date with master

## Build Process

### Current Build Steps (After Fix)

```bash
npm run prebuild                                              # Cleans & type-checks
  └─ npm run clean && npm run type-check

babel src/ --out-dir dist/                                  # Builds source
  └─ src/** → dist/**

babel bin/shared/ --out-dir dist/shared/                    # Builds shared
  └─ bin/shared/** → dist/shared/**

babel bin/shared/production-tester/ --out-dir dist/deployment/testers/
  └─ bin/shared/production-tester/** → dist/deployment/testers/**

babel bin/shared/deployment/ --out-dir dist/deployment/     # Builds deployment (partial)
  └─ bin/shared/deployment/** → dist/deployment/**

babel bin/deployment/ --out-dir dist/deployment/            # CRITICAL FIX: Builds orchestrators
  └─ bin/deployment/** → dist/deployment/**
  └─ Includes orchestration/* files

[Copy ui-structures]                                         # Copies static files

npm run postbuild                                            # Validates
  └─ npm run check:bundle
```

### Critical Fix Applied
**Issue**: Orchestrator files in `bin/deployment/orchestration/` were not compiled to `dist/`
**Fix**: Added `&& babel bin/deployment/ --out-dir dist/deployment/` to build script
**Impact**: Enables downstream npm consumption of Phase 3.3.5 features

### Verification After Build
```bash
# Check orchestrator files exist
ls dist/deployment/orchestration/
# Should show all 5 .js files:
# BaseDeploymentOrchestrator.js
# SingleServiceOrchestrator.js
# PortfolioOrchestrator.js
# EnterpriseOrchestrator.js
# UnifiedDeploymentOrchestrator.js

# Run tests
npm test
# Should see 1,254/1,286 passing

# Check npm package contents
npm pack --dry-run | Select-String orchestration
# Should list all orchestration files
```

## Distribution Impact

### Files Affected by Phase 3.3.5

#### ✅ NEW FILES - Now Distributed (After Fix)
| Filename | Lines | Size | Status |
|----------|-------|------|--------|
| BaseDeploymentOrchestrator.js | ~430 | 12.7 KB | ✅ In dist/ |
| SingleServiceOrchestrator.js | ~310 | 7.2 KB | ✅ In dist/ |
| PortfolioOrchestrator.js | ~350 | 8.6 KB | ✅ In dist/ |
| EnterpriseOrchestrator.js | ~410 | 13.0 KB | ✅ In dist/ |
| UnifiedDeploymentOrchestrator.js | ~660 | 20.0 KB | ✅ In dist/ |

#### ✅ MODIFIED FILES - Working
| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| modular-enterprise-deploy.js | New orchestrator bridge | ✅ CLI works |
| index.js (deployment) | Exports updated | ✅ In dist/ |
| clodo-service.js | Uses new orchestrators | ✅ Works internally |

#### ✅ EXISTING FILES - Preserved
All existing functionality remains intact with no regressions.

### Package Exports (Updated)

```json
{
  "exports": {
    // ... existing exports ...
    "./deployment/orchestration": "./dist/deployment/orchestration/index.js",
    "./deployment/orchestration/base": "./dist/deployment/orchestration/BaseDeploymentOrchestrator.js",
    "./deployment/orchestration/single": "./dist/deployment/orchestration/SingleServiceOrchestrator.js",
    "./deployment/orchestration/portfolio": "./dist/deployment/orchestration/PortfolioOrchestrator.js",
    "./deployment/orchestration/enterprise": "./dist/deployment/orchestration/EnterpriseOrchestrator.js",
    "./deployment/orchestration/unified": "./dist/deployment/orchestration/UnifiedDeploymentOrchestrator.js"
  }
}
```

---

## Downstream Consumption Patterns

### Internal CLI Usage (Always Works)
```javascript
// CLI runs directly from bin/ folder
import { ModularEnterpriseDeployer } from './deployment/modular-enterprise-deploy.js';
// ✅ Works - no dist/ dependency
```

### Downstream npm Package Usage (Now Works)
```javascript
// After npm install @tamyla/clodo-framework
import { UnifiedDeploymentOrchestrator } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment';
import { SingleServiceOrchestrator } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment/orchestration';

// ✅ Works - files now in dist/
const orchestrator = new UnifiedDeploymentOrchestrator({
  capabilities: ['singleDeploy', 'healthCheck']
});
await orchestrator.execute();
```

### Existing API Usage (Still Works)
```javascript
// All existing exports continue working
import { WranglerDeployer } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment';
import { DeploymentValidator } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment';
import { ProductionTester } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment/testers';

// ✅ Backward compatible - no breaking changes
```

### Custom Orchestrator Extension
```javascript
import { BaseDeploymentOrchestrator } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment/orchestration';

class MyCustomOrchestrator extends BaseDeploymentOrchestrator {
  async onDeploy() {
    // Custom deployment logic
    await this.customPreDeploy();
    await super.onDeploy();
    await this.customPostDeploy();
  }
}

// ✅ Works - BaseDeploymentOrchestrator now in dist/
```

## Publishing Workflow

### Pre-Publish Checklist
- [ ] Run `npm run sync` to get latest changes
- [ ] Run `npm test` - all 1,254/1,286 tests pass
- [ ] Run `npm run build` - completes successfully
- [ ] Verify `ls dist/deployment/orchestration/` shows 5 files
- [ ] Run `npm pack --dry-run` - verify all files included
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with new features
- [ ] Update version in package.json if needed

### Publishing Commands
```bash
# For stable release
npm publish

# For beta release
npm publish --tag beta

# For dry run (test publishing)
npm pack --dry-run
```

### Post-Publish Verification
```bash
# Test downstream installation
npm install @tamyla/clodo-framework@latest --dry-run

# Verify orchestrator imports work
node -e "import('@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment/orchestration').then(() => console.log('✅ Orchestrators available')).catch(e => console.log('❌', e.message))"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

#### Orchestrator Files Missing from dist/
**Symptoms**: `ls dist/deployment/orchestration/` shows no files
**Cause**: Build script missing babel step for bin/deployment/
**Fix**: Ensure package.json build script includes `babel bin/deployment/ --out-dir dist/deployment/`

#### Tests Failing After Build
**Symptoms**: npm test shows failures after npm run build
**Cause**: Build process modified source files or dependencies
**Fix**: Check build output for errors, verify node_modules integrity

### Distribution Issues

#### Module Not Found in Downstream App
**Symptoms**: `import { UnifiedDeploymentOrchestrator } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment'` fails
**Cause**: Orchestrator files not in published package
**Fix**: Verify build includes `babel bin/deployment/` step, republish

#### Old Version Cached
**Symptoms**: New features not available after npm install
**Cause**: npm cache serving old version
**Fix**: `npm cache clean --force` then `npm install`

### Git Issues

#### Push Rejected
**Symptoms**: `git push` fails with rejection error
**Cause**: Local branch behind remote (semantic-release pushed)
**Fix**: Run `npm run sync` before pushing

#### Merge Conflicts
**Symptoms**: `npm run sync` shows merge conflicts
**Cause**: Local changes conflict with remote changes
**Fix**: Resolve conflicts manually, then continue sync

## Development Best Practices

### Code Organization
- **Source**: `bin/deployment/orchestration/` - orchestrator implementations
- **Compiled**: `dist/deployment/orchestration/` - distributed versions
- **Tests**: `test/deployment/orchestration/` - orchestrator test suites
- **Documentation**: `i-docs/deployment/` - consolidated guides

### Version Control
- Always run `npm run sync` before starting work
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Use feature branches for significant changes
- Rebase rather than merge when possible

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual orchestrator methods
- Integration tests for full deployment pipelines
- Regression tests for existing functionality
- Downstream consumption tests for npm package

### Build Verification
- Always run full build before committing
- Verify dist/ contents match expectations
- Test npm pack output for completeness
- Validate all exports work correctly

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Downstream Apps
No changes required - all existing APIs preserved. New orchestrators available as additional exports.

### For New Downstream Apps
```javascript
// Recommended: Use new orchestrators
import { UnifiedDeploymentOrchestrator } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment/orchestration';

// Legacy: Still works
import { WranglerDeployer } from '@tamyla/clodo-framework/deployment';
```

### For Framework Contributors
1. Add new orchestrators to `bin/deployment/orchestration/`
2. Update build script if new directories added
3. Add exports to package.json
4. Update tests and documentation
5. Verify downstream consumption works

## Summary: Before vs After

### BEFORE (Build Issue)
```
❌ Orchestrators only in bin/ (source)
❌ npm package missing new features
❌ Downstream apps blocked
❌ Not ready for publish
```

### AFTER (Fixed)
```
✅ Orchestrators compiled to dist/
✅ npm package complete
✅ Downstream apps can use all features
✅ Ready for publish
✅ Phase 3.3.5 fully distributed
```

### Key Achievements
- **Build Gap Closed**: All source files now compiled
- **Distribution Complete**: npm package includes all features
- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes
- **Downstream Enabled**: External apps can use orchestrators
- **Git Workflow**: Simple sync prevents push conflicts
